Hi everyone, it's has been a long time since I uploaded my last post. Now I want to show you a medium algorithm problem that you can see in FAANG interviews.

### Problem
From a given matrix of number. Write a function that can check if you can for from top-left to bottom-right with one rule:

- You can only move to one spot that is slower than the current one.

*Hint: It's a problem that can be solving by seeing matrix as a tree*
